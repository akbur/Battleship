//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

PLAN - TO DO 

-Read over the standards that Hack Reactor sent for their program / airbnb styling guide

-When Player is placing ship, hover the image of the ship
-Don't allow ship overlap during placement
-Work on CSS to make the gameboard nice
-Get rid of Ship heading and rotate button after ships are placed.
	-maybe instead of hiding buttons, contain all of it in a container and hide the entire thing when ships are placed, 
	-could put a message window there, instead, to display who the winner is.
-Gameover / winner when all ships have been sunk
-(SmarterComputer) - make it so that before going back to random, see if there has been an initial hit on any ships (that may have been abandoned if ships were touching)

PROBLEMS
-figure out a better solution for all these global scope variables


AND
-combine markplayercell & markcomputercell?
