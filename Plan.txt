//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

GAMEPLAY
-ship hover only on legal placements (to avoid current error)
	^must fix legal placement first - no ship overlap allowed
-(SmarterComputer) - make it so that before going back to random, see if there has been an initial hit on any ships (that may have been abandoned if ships were placed touching)
-perhaps player can't select cell they've already selected/

-Fix removing click handlers after game is over
-Win message showing twice when player wins, then repeatedly
	upon clicking the gameboard and computer continues to move


TODO After basic gameplay is complete: 
-when window is minimized, enemy fleet should be below the first board, instead both heading are on top
-figure out a better solution for all these global scope variables
-take out console.logs and debug stuff
-Read over the standards that Hack Reactor sent for their program / airbnb styling guide and make changes (should have done that first)
-get rid of purple ship color
-add more comments
