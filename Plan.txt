//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

GAMEPLAY
-ship hover should be correct ship size
-Don't allow ship overlap during placement
-(SmarterComputer) - make it so that before going back to random, see if there has been an initial hit on any ships (that may have been abandoned if ships were placed touching)
-win message appears twice on player wins
-perhaps player can't select cell they've already selected/

DIV STYLING STUFF
change place your ship heading to dynamically created
can i remove an entire div? not just hide? or if i hide can i place a new div in its place?
disappear place ships, ship buttons, rotate button
add new div in its place that will hold congrats message with a play again buton
congrats message needs appropriate css styling


TODO After basic gameplay is complete: 
-when window is minimized, enemy fleet should be below the first board, instead both heading are on top
-figure out a better solution for all these global scope variables
-take out console.logs and debug stuff
-Read over the standards that Hack Reactor sent for their program / airbnb styling guide and make changes (should have done that first)
-get rid of purple ship color
