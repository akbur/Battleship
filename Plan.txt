//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

PLAN - TO DO 

-When Player is placing ship, hover the image of the ship
-Don't allow illegal ship placements by player
-Make the computer's guesses smarter after hitting a ship
-Work on CSS to make the gameboard prettier
-Get rid of Ship heading and rotate button after ships are placed.
	-maybe instead of hiding buttons, contain all of it in a container and hide the entire thing when ships are placed, 
	-could put a message window there, instead, to display who the winner is.

-Make code more DRY - especially when I have 2 different functions for player & computer that do basically the same thing
-Some functions do many things, make more specific functions.
