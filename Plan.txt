//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

PLAN - TO DO 

-Read over the standards that Hack Reactor sent for their program / airbnb styling guide?

-When Player is placing ship, hover the image of the ship
-Don't allow illegal ship placements by player
-Make the computer's guesses smarter after hitting a ship
-Work on CSS to make the gameboard nice
-Get rid of Ship heading and rotate button after ships are placed.
	-maybe instead of hiding buttons, contain all of it in a container and hide the entire thing when ships are placed, 
	-could put a message window there, instead, to display who the winner is.


PROBLEMS
-Problems with click handlers
-Need to remove the ship placement click handler after the ships are placed
(i think that should solve the problem)
-figure out a better solution for all these global scope variables

-combine markplayercell & markcomputercell?

WITH COMPUTER CHOICES:
-Seems to work as long as all are seperate until the ship is sunk
-Need to stop choosing moves from the plan and go back to random
	whenever the ship would be sunk (since at the time of making the move plan
	we haven't fired yet)
-Need to make sure direction also changes when we run into a wall
-Need to make corrections for if the ships are placed together, such as checking
	to see if ships have been hit & not sunk (which could happen if ships are
	touching)
