//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

GAMEPLAY
-ship hover only on legal placements (to avoid current error)
	^must fix legal placement first - no ship overlap allowed
-perhaps player can't select cell they've already selected/

-(SmarterComputer) - make it so that before going back to random, see if there has been an initial hit on any ships (that may have been abandoned if ships were placed touching)
-I think the interruption seems to come when player hits while computer hitting

TODO After basic gameplay is complete: 
-when window is minimized, enemy fleet should be below the first board, instead both heading are on top
-figure out a better solution for all these global scope variables
-take out console.logs and debug stuff
-Read over the standards that Hack Reactor sent for their program / airbnb styling guide and make changes (should have done that first)
-get rid of purple ship color
-add more comments

IMPROVEMENTS
-Add Play Again Button at the end.
-Add instructions after the ships disappear in a instruct-block
-Currently, cells aren't being marked at the end of the game, but if player continues to click the scrren, cells are being chosen by computer behind the scenes
-Improve CSS styling
-Add an Auto Place Ship button for player
-Make it so ships aren't placed so close together.
-Implement Higher Order Functions
