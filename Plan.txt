//Text Based Battleship Game Plan

PLAN - TO DO 

-When Player is placing ship, hover the image of the ship
-Don't allow illegal ship placements by player
-Make the computer's guesses smarter after hitting a ship
-Work on CSS to make the gameboard nice
-Get rid of Ship heading and rotate button after ships are placed.
	-maybe instead of hiding buttons, contain all of it in a container and hide the entire thing when ships are placed, 
	-could put a message window there, instead, to display who the winner is.


PROBLEMS
-Problems with click handlers
-Look at move plan stage 2 , specifically issues with 'current direction' not changing & scope
